Space Complexity O(1):
      
       Space complexity is the amount  of memory  used  by the program to execute and produce the result.

Linear Space Complexity O(n):
      
      If the amount of space required by an program is increased with the increase of input value.
      
Quadratic space complexity O(n^2):
      In quadratic space complexity ,if we take integer ,integer has 4 bytes then it takes 4*n*n bytes of memory.
      so we remove constant then it has O(n^2) space complexity.
